IRCBot-py
=========

Basically, this aims to be a Python port of my Ruby IRC bot.
This is a toy project in python that I intend to use for stuff like
system monitoring and other noise-making on IRC.

How to add functionalities
==========================

Implement functions with the following prototype:
  def fn(nickname, hostname, destination, message)

Write a regex matching the PRIVMSG you want it to match.

Call add_privmsg_callback.

State
=====

For now not at all ready for any production. Still lacks proper facilities
for external manipulation, configuration files, an interactive prompt,
a standardized way to load plug-ins, multi-server support (though one process
per server could od), getting some constants out of the code, proper disconnect.

Still pushing it so people can derivate from it if they dare.
